=========================================== TODO ===========================================

>> Classes to implement or work on  

   - Update Makefile to shorter (and easier) version 

   - eInclusiveCrossSection 
     - Implement this (and F1F209) and remove CrossSection 

   - Generator
     - Rotations from HCS to TCS  
   
   - LeRoseOptics
     - Finish work on the method ReconstructTarget (still need to get z_react)  

   - Transporter 
     - Figure out how to apply various transport methods from Huan's code in a more 
       intuitive manner
     
        - SAMCEvent::GetRef_Plane()
          - Transports the event to the focal plane, using only multiple scattering
          - Then transports the event back to the target in vacuum
            - This gives the 'refined' target variables.  These are the variables
              that are transported to the focal plane.   
     
        - SAMCEvent::Transport()  
          - Called by GetRef_Plane()
          - Effectively APPLIES multiple scattering for a given MATERIAL 
          - Multiple scattering CALCULATION is applied here
     
        - Private data member: abstract Optics class? 

>>  Implement 'main' program 

    - Use of FileManager class

    - Event loop 
     - Use of Generator, SAMCEvent, LeRoseOptics, Material, Physics, 
       CrossSection and AnalysisManager classes 
     - Need to couple the use of Physics and SAMCEvent classes. How to apply results
       of energy loss and multiple scattering to SAMCEvent? Also need to make use of 
       boolean switches to turn on and off these processes.  

>> Extra details:   

   - AnalyzerOptics 
     - Why is the LoadData() method so slow?  
     - Is there a way to implement TransportToFocalPlane()? 

   - FileManager
     - Did we get everything?
